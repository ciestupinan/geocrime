# GeoCrime

GeoCrime displays up-to-date police report data from the San Francisco Police Department using the Google Maps API. Reports included are "those for incidents that occurred starting January 1, 2018 onward and have been approved by a supervising officer". Features include color coded incidents, tool tips displaying incident information, ability to clearly display multiple incidents at the same location, and dynamic filtering.

This project was worked on as part of the [Hackbright Academy's Full-Time Software Engineering program](https://hackbrightacademy.com/software-engineering-program/).

### Dataset: Police Department Incident Reports: 2018 to PresentPublic Safety
This [dataset](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783) includes "police incident reports filed by officers and by individuals through self-service online reporting for non-emergency cases. Reports included are those for incidents that occurred starting January 1, 2018 onward and have been approved by a supervising officer."


### Overlapping Marker Spiderfier Library

Using the Google marker clustering library helps deal with markers that are close together, but doesn't allow you to access all the markers at one point.  This [library](https://github.com/jawj/OverlappingMarkerSpiderfier) allows markers at the same point to spiderfy into a circle. Without this, only the top marker would be visable and usable.
